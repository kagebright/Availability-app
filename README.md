## Description
This a personal project of mine to create a user-friendly app that allows friends to input their availability and schedule hangouts together.

I want to be able to easily input my availability for different days and times 
So that my friends can see when I'm free to hang out 
I also want to be able to view my friends' availability and search for new friends on the app to connect with 
The app should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, so I can quickly input and view my availability without any confusion. With the help of this app, 
I hope to schedule more hangouts with my friends and spend more quality time with them. `
