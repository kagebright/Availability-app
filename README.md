# Availability App

## Description
This a personal project of mine to create a user-friendly app that allows friends to input their availability and schedule hangouts together.

## Features
- Input availability: Users can easily input their availability for different days and times.
- View friends' availability: Users can view their friends' availability and plan hangouts based on the common free time.
- Search for friends: Users can search for and connect with their friends on the app, to view each other's availability and schedule hangouts together.
- User-friendly interface: The app has a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, so users can quickly input and view their availability.

## Technical Details
The app is built using;
- Front-end: 
- Back-end: JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB
The front-end handles the user interface and interactions, while the back-end handles the data and the logic of the app.
